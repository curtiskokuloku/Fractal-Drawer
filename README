Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
--> I used the Scanner class to ask the user for the radius of the circle, and height and width of the triangle and rectangle

Any known bugs or defects in the program
--> jApplet in teh Canvas class gave a warning that it is outdated, but the code still runs
